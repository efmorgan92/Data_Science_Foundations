# Data_Science_Foundations
With the goals of gaining experience in data analysis and visualization, as well as building a strong foundation in R, I completed the Springboard.com Foundations in Data Science Course. This repository contains all relevant coursework.

I have since used the skills learned to lead an analysis of variation in surgical supply spending within my current position.
